/* Miscellaneous notes & stuff:    [intentionally not a Doxygen comment]
 *
 * - Logging to pools is possible (implemented via the "log to function"
 *   capability here) but is implemented in libPlasma/c, since libLoam
 *   doesn't know anything about pools.  See libPlasma/c/pool-log.h
 *
 * - Controlling logging via environment variable is very well-defined
 *   and fleshed out, as documented below.  Logging options can also
 *   be set under program control, and all the functions and structures
 *   you need to do that are defined in this header file.  But, they are
 *   very low-level and only sparsely documented.  There should be a
 *   higher-level API for controlling logging.  Currently, the closest
 *   thing to this, which is very minimal and ad-hoc, is a couple of
 *   functions at the end of libPlasma/c/pool_cmd.[ch].  They are mostly
 *   meant for use by plasma utilities, but could be called by other
 *   programs (since nearly all Oblong apps depend on libPlasma anyway),
 *   or could be used as a source of inspiration for writing additional
 *   functions.
 *
 * - A separate, C++-based logging facility exists in libBasement/Logger.h.
 *   It had once had some aspirations of being merged with this facility,
 *   but that has not yet happened.  (bug 817)
 *
 * - There were also once some aspirations that this long, header-file
 *   based documentation would move to some more appropriate Jeffy-provided
 *   location, where it would be more accessible to users of the SDK.
 *
 * - The "begin usage" and "end usage" comments below are used by
 *   generate-ob-log-usage.hs to auto-generate the usage message in
 *   ob-log.c.

/**

 *
 * C API for low-level logging.
 *
 * There are six pre-defined log levels: OBLV_BUG, OBLV_ERROR,
 * OBLV_DEPRECATION, OBLV_WARN, OBLV_INFO, and OBLV_DEBUG. Besides these
 * predefined levels, you can also define your own levels if you have
 * special needs, since a log level is actually just a structure.
 *
 * For the six predefined levels, it's possible to configure their
 * behavior via the OB_LOG environment variable.
 *
 * <!-- begin usage -->
 *
 * The OB_LOG environment variable consists of space-separated
 * tokens, like this:
 *
 * LEVEL [option [option ...]] [LEVEL [option [option ...]] ...]
 *
 * Where LEVEL is one of: BUG, ERROR, DEPRECATION, WARN, INFO, or DEBUG
 *
 * And options are:
 *   (flag-like options can be prefixed with "no" to turn them off)
 *
 * stderr - log to standard error
 *
 * ./file/name - log to the named file (must contain a slash)
 *
 * nofd - don't log to previously specified file or stderr
 *
 * [no]syslog - log to syslog
 *
 * [no]stack - include stack trace when printing message
 *
 * [no]time - print time along with message
 *
 * [no]full - print full filename and line number with message
 *
 * [no]base - print file basename and line number with message
 *
 * [no]code - print 64-bit "code" (see below) with message
 *
 * [no]pid - print process ID with message
 *
 * [no]prog - print program name with message
 *
 * [no]tid - print thread ID with message
 *
 * none - turn off logging for all codes (same as "????????????????=off")
 *
 * +pattern - always turn on logging from source files that match
 *            "pattern" (which is a glob pattern) regardless of
 *            the code matching (below)
 *
 * -pattern - always turn off logging from source files that match
 *            "pattern" (which is a glob pattern) regardless of
 *            the code matching (below)
 *
 *            The glob pattern is matched against __FILE__, which is
 *            usually only the basename; see
 *            https://lists.oblong.com/pipermail/dev/2013-January/000310.html
 *
 * xxxx????=on - turn on logging for the specified range of codes
 *
 * xxxx????=off - turn off logging for the specified range of codes
 *
 * xxxx????=\<count\> - log at most "count" messages for the specified
 * range of codes
 *
 * xxxx????:\<count\> - log at most "count" instances of *each* individual
 * code within the specified range of codes
 *
 * In the above, "xxxx????" indicates a string of hex digits, where a
 * digit may also be replaced by a question mark.  (But question marks
 * may only appear in trailing positions, not anywhere in the string.)
 * This is a way of specifying a 64-bit "code", optionally with some
 * number (although a multiple of four) of low-order bits masked out.
 * Because of hierarchical nature of codes, this lets you control
 * behavior for an entire module at a time.
 *
 * If not modified by the OB_LOG environment variable, the default is
 * for log messages to include the "code" if one if given, or the file
 * basename and line number if the "code" is zero.  The thread ID is
 * printed for threads which are not the main thread.  The
 * "programming" log levels (BUG and DEPRECATION) print stack traces.
 * All log levels print to stderr, except DEBUG, which is disabled by
 * default.
 *
 * Note that the DEBUG level is disabled by virtue of not going to any
 * destination, but all codes are enabled for it.  Therefore, if you
 * enable debug messages with something like "DEBUG stderr", you will
 * get all debug messages!  If you only want to print a few debug
 * messages, you need to use "none" before enabling the codes you
 * want.  For example:
 *
 * OB_LOG="DEBUG stderr none 20108???=on"
 *
 * <!-- end usage -->
 *
 * Most logging can be done with ob_log() and ob_log_loc().
 * ob_log_loc() requires you to pass in a filename and line number
 * (useful if, for example, you really want to log the location of
 * whoever called you, rather than your own location), but for the
 * most common case, ob_log() is a convenience macro which calls
 * ob_log_loc() with __FILE__ and __LINE__ automatically.
 *
 * You must also supply a log level (which can be one of the six
 * predefined levels, or a pointer to an ob_log_level structure.  You
 * can also optionally supply a "code" (or 0 if you don't want to
 * supply a unique code).  A "code" is a unique 64-bit identifier
 * which indicates which message is being logged.  There are at least
 * three benefits to specifying such an identifier for each of your
 * log messages:
 *
 * 1. Allows individual messages to be turned on or off from the
 *    OB_LOG environment variable.  And since the bits in "code"
 *    are allocated hierarchically, by using a mask you can also
 *    enable or disable logging for entire modules at once.
 *
 * 2. Log messages can be suppressed once they have been printed
 *    a certain number of times, to avoid spamming the user.  The
 *    unique code identifies messages for this purpose.
 *
 * 3. The code can optionally be printed with the message, which may
 *    make customer support easier, since they can quote a specific
 *    number, rather than reading back the text of the message and
 *    possibly getting it wrong.
 *
 * Log messages are printf formatted, and the formatting is only done
 * if the message is going to be printed.  (This only concerns you if
 * you are using the dubious "%n" format, or if you are concerned
 * about the efficiency of suppressed messages.)  As a matter of
 * style, log messages should end in a newline-- however, if the
 * newline is missing, it will be added for you.  If a message
 * contains internal newlines, it will be formatted as a multiline
 * message, where each line will be prefixed with "(m/n): ", where n
 * is the total number of lines in the message, and n is the current
 * line number, between 1 and n, inclusive.
