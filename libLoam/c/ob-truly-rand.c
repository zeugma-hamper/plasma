/* A cryptographically secure pseudo-random number generator:
 *
 * <s>
 * On OS X, use arc4random(), which is a user-space CSPRNG seeded from
 * /dev/urandom, but we have to work around two problems with it:
 *  - its state is duplicated by fork(), so we must force a reseed on fork
 *  - it never reseeds automatically, so we reseed it every 20 minutes
 * </s>
 *
 * Don't use arc4random on OS X anymore, because:
 *  - RC4 is considered to be not-very-secure
 *  - arc4random never fails; i. e. it uses an insecure seed (which is
 *    very bad) if it can't read from /dev/urandom
 *
 * So for now, use ISAAC-64 on OS X as well as Linux.  Eventually, we
 * should switch to something like libottery, once it becomes mature.
 *
 * On Linux, there is no built-in equivalent of arc4random (which is
 * somewhat ironic, since the Linux manual page for /dev/urandom is
 * much more stern than the OS X one about the fact that you should
 * be using the device to seed a CSPRNG, not getting all your random
 * numbers directly from the device), so we write our own equivalent
 * which is in the same spirit as arc4random, except that we use
 * the ISAAC-64 CSPRNG instead of ARC4.  (ISAAC-64 is faster than ARC4,
 * and might be of higher quality.)
 *
 * On Windows, we use CryptGenRandom directly, without having our own
 * CSPRNG, since my understanding is that CryptGenRandom is already
 * a userspace CSPRNG seeded from kernel entropy, much like arc4random.
 * (However, this is based on MS's scanty documentation.)
 *
 * On all three OSes, we have some amount of global state, so we use
 * a mutex to make things thread-safe.
 *
 * Note: for both arc4random and ISAAC-64, these algorithms do not
 * offer backtracking resistance.  So, although they are cryptographically
 * secure, they may not be satisfactory to the most paranoid users.
 * Since the Windows implementation is opaque, it's less clear whether
 * they offer backtracking resistance.  Some sources suggest that newer
 * versions (Windows 7) do, but older versions (Windows XP) don't.
 *
 * Oh, one more thing: starting with Ivy Bridge (spring 2012), Intel
 * will have a new instruction, RdRand (code-named Bull Mountain),
 * which generates random numbers in hardware, which should be faster
 * and higher quality than any of the above methods.  This file currently
 * has stubs showing where Bull Mountain support should go, but it's
 * waiting to be fleshed out once we actually have hardware to test on. */
